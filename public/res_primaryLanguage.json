      "description": "üëã I'm Sergii Otryshko, a software developer with a background in law, telecommunications and customer service. I graduated  from Kyiv National Linguistic University with a master's degree in business law and after trying several different professions I fell in love with software development because of the truly unlimited number of options and possibilities it gives you and the potential to make the world a better place. Also I've always enjoyed solving puzzles so I guess I can call that the icing on the cake for me. I have various work experiences such as working as a legal assistant, cable technician and delivery driver, also I have a strong background in customer service. I firmly believe that I can leverage all my previous experience to my advantage in my new career to approach problems from non-standard angles and come up with customer-oriented solutions.",
